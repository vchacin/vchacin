### Hi there, I'm Victoria ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend web developer working with React, building my professional career in the IT area with startups dedicated to computer services.
I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as public as possible.
Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL.

## Get in touch ðŸ’¬
